- Next steps: more epochs
- Describe label distribution for each dataset used from MedMNISTv2
- Compute the balanced accuracy, some datasets are imbalanced
- Performance with bigger size 224x224, across the datasets where the bigger image is available
- Create a hyperparameter table, with the value used and the justification.
- Do a review of what other people have done with this dataset
- Do an ethics amendment for MedMNISTv2

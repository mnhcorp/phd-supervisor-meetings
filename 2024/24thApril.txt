- Flesh out discussion section of the MIUA paper (talk about how the data distribution across the train/val/test sets MAY have led to the performance drop).
- Proceed with other datasets in MedMNISTv2 (2D & 3D)
- Poster can be about the MIUA paper
- Cross-valdiation has empirically not performed well on unseed datasets, use with caution and always have a test set
- Try the Pneumonia model on other Pneumonia datasets (there may be many)
- If you want to slide the missed hyperparameter, be transparent and suggestion is to not touch the Pneumonia and Breast test set again.
- Add images to the paper (and the poster)

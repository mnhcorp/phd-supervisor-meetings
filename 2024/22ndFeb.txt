0. Get access to the new 40GB VRAM GPU server in the University.
1. Binary classification task to predict mutation status from imaging data using Perceiver is a good start.
2. Perform data analysis for the CT scans, make sure you use images from the same type/calibration.
3. Use only CT scans, so 81+3 patients. Don't use MRI scans. Re-check label distribution on the new set.
4. If each patient has multiple studies then use scans from the first one. This is when the tumor/disease was first reported, the later scans would have had some treatment.
5. Check dataset citation and search Google scholar/other places to see if other people have used this dataset, with or without the Perceiver architecture. Good to have some numbers.
6. Check the deadline for submission for MIUA 2024, and think about a submission for this experiment if the timing permits.
7. Good to have some early results before the next meeting (14th March)

- The AUC for some of the runs are at 0.500 even with a high accuracy, this is weird and needs more investigation
- Comparison with the 224x224 benchmark from MedMNISTv2
- Balanced accuracy and/or weighted cost function
- Multiple runs with different seeds, take the best one.
- Hyper-parameter tuning with small set of hyper parameters
- For all possible hyper-parameter configurations, run a minimum of 100-120 epochs
- Check the MedMNISTv2 paper for learning rate, batch_size, epochs
- Larger batch sizes for bigger datasets
- MIUA paper draft by Wednesday
- Focus on pneumoniamnist & breastmnist
- Check SOTA performance on pneumoniamnist & breastmnist (even without Perceiver)
- Admin: Push to supervisor meeting notes to MMS
